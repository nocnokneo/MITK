\section meshdecimationOverview Overview

MeshDecimation is a user friendly tool to decimate a MITK surface.

\section meshdecimationFeatures Features

The view offers two basic procedures to decimate surfaces:
One that reduces a surface with a possible loss of topology (quality), but with a garuanteed reduction rate that is expressed in terms of percent of the original mesh.
The other variant preserves the topology and stops decimating the mesh when it detects major topological changes.

\section meshdecimationUsage Usage

The usage of the view is straightforward, as shown in the screenshot.
To decimate a MITK surface do the following:
- Select a surface in the datamanager
- Enter a target reduction rate
- Select a decimation method (\ref meshdecimationFeatures)
- Press the "Decimate" button
- Repeat the process until you are satisfied with the decimation
- Save the surface to disk
